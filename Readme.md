# Stock Price Prediction

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning models. It fetches historical stock data, processes it, and uses a trained model to predict future trends. The project is implemented using Python, Streamlit for the user interface, and libraries like Keras, pandas, and yfinance.

## Overview

This project predicts stock prices using a machine learning model trained on historical stock data. It features an interactive interface built with Streamlit.

## Features

- Fetches historical stock data using `yfinance`.
- Predicts stock prices using a pre-trained Keras model.
- Visualizes stock trends and predictions.

## usage

1. Run the Application

Launch the Streamlit application: streamlit run stock.py
